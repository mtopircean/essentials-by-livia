# Essentials by Livia

The website was create to support users interested in alternative medicine, more specifically in Essential Oils by Dottera.

It is a tool that offers the possibility to better understand this products from the perspective of targeted ailments thorugh the recommandation section.
It also connects the user with the team behind this and offers the possibility to join them on this journey

Users can access and see the best deals for this products and by joining the team, they can enter the sales scheme and earn by recommending products to other users.

Idea originated from my familys experience with this products and my wife`s journey as a Dottera representative.
